# StockAnalyzer

Goal is to be able to use ML models to interpret articles off Yahoo! Finance to analyze stocks. ðŸ“ˆ

Currently, I'm learning Python and playing around with Beautiful soup to scrape real-time information off stocks, such as the price, P/E ratio, etc., and fetch the most recent articles.
My next step would be to interpret articles scraped off the site, and make forecasts, predictions, or anything else that's related! Stay tuned :)
